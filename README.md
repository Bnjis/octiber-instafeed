# octiber-instafeed

A Simple plugin for October CMS with the new [Instagram Graph API](https://developers.facebook.com/products/instagram/)

I made this plugin for a personal project so I share it with the comunity

To use this plugin, you need :

- Your instagram business ID
- A facebook app_id
- A facebook app_secret
- A access_token

Facebook provide short timed access_token, you need to generate a permanent access_token for yout app.
To generate this token, i create a tool :
[Facebook Permanent Access Token Generator](https://bnjis.github.io/Facebook-permanent-token-generator/)
You can find the documentation [here](https://github.com/Bnjis/Facebook-permanent-token-generator)

### IMPORTANT: Unsupported

Currently I do not have the time and abillity to support this plugin.
You can use it free to use it, but I may not be able to provide help if it is required.
